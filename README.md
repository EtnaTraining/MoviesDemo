# Titanium Movie List demo

After watching the presentation of React Native [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rDsRXj9-cU) at the Facebook React.js Conf 2015, I decided to implement the very same app, but using [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/), to demonstrate that what React Native will do (it's still in private beta) could have been done with Titanium since 2011.

Unfortunately, most of the developers associate Titanium with PhoneGap, cause both use HTML/CSS/JS to develop mobile apps, but the **huge difference** is that while PhoneGap renders app into a WebView, providing a responsive web app as User Interface, Titanium use generates a **native User Interface**, using UIKit on iOS and native widgets on Android.

It will follow a video where I will show how to build the application in less than 1 hour.
